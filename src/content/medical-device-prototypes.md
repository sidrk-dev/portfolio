## Overview

During my internship at Texas Children's Hospital TIGr Lab, I engineered two automated lab devices to replace expensive commercial alternatives.

---

## 1. Sample Flipper

A programmable device to gently invert blood sample vials at specific intervals.

- **Tech:** Arduino, Stepper Motors, 3D printed chassis.

---

## 2. Precision Dipper

An automated dipping mechanism for slide staining.

- **Tech:** Linear rails, TMC2209 drivers for silent operation, custom G-code parser.

Both devices are currently in use by the research team, improving workflow efficiency and reproducibility.
